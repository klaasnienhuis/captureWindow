# Capture window screengrabber for 3ds Max
This project consits of a single scriptfile which enables the user to capture any window, screen, viewport or control inside or outside 3dsMax.

# Documentation
Using the script is very easy: open the script, specify a location where you want the captured window to go press the big "Captue window" button and click on a window or viewport. The captured window is shown in the script (scaled down or up to fit). You can capture as many windows as diskspace allows. If you've pressed the "Capture window" button but you've changed your mind: just press the escape-key.
To get to the images: press the "Open folder" button. This opens the folder in an explorer window.
##Installing the script
The script comes as an .mzp file. This is a self-extracting file specifically made for 3dsMax. You can either drop the file on one of the viewports or run it by going into the main menu > maxscript > run script. After doing either of these, you'll get a dialog which tells you how you can add the script to your interface. You can add it as an icon on a toolbar, give it a keyboard shortcut or add it to a menu or quad. If you've added it as an icon to a toolbar for instance, you then just click the icon to run the script.
